CLEANED POST:  BURNING | Kris Aquino in full beast mode on Instagram! Read each exchange and see how the former presidential sister burns the instagram Highway as she rants against Korina Sanchez, a tv host and perennial pageant judge for both local and national contests. Kris and Korina once hosted a morning show together and were even on the same political ?? side ?? in the recent elections. But there was no stopping Kris from hitting ?? post ?? for a now-viral lash-out against former co-host Korina Sanchez over a television magazine show feature on the former's ex-husband, James Yap. In case you ?? ve been hiding under a rock the entire weekend, here ?? s a quick background. Kris, who signed a movie deal with Star Cinema on April 20, recently broke her silence against James Yap. The reason was deeply personal and fundamental. James had apparently made rather rude and hurtful statements about Bimby, his son with Kris. Bimby turned 11 years old on April 19. So what triggered the rant against Korina, whom Kris deliberately did not name in the viral post? Rated K, the ABS-CBN show Korina hosts, did a feature on James and his young family for its April 22, Sunday episode. The episode did not sit well with Kris, who said it was a slap to her face. And if the points Kris raised in her post are any indication, her issues with Korina run deep. So, which team are you on. Team Kris or Team Korina? .

I'm a huge One Piece fan so Pirates of the Caribbean is definitely amazing to watch. Plus, who does not love Jack? The hardest part about this costume was the wig. It's actually 3 different wigs sewn together. I hand made all the dreads and beaded, attached and braded everything on it. So much time on it but I loved how it came out! The rest of the costume was made by me as well! Definitely plan on wearing it out somewhere ~? Anyway, I really hope you guys enjoyed this theme. I'm a huge fan of Depp characters so it was truly an honor ?? More themes coming soon! Thanks guys for the support. If you guys would like to support it even more, consider becoming a Patreon. Link in bio? Mucho love <3 ~.
