CLEANED POST:  To all La Sallians. There are more posts in social media to try to break our team. Enough is enough. We need you guys to spread this and defend the team, our school and our community - We, the management, coaches, players and staff of the DLSU Senior Men's Basketball Team, are one in congratulating Ateneo for winning the UAAP championship this season . While we fell short of retaining the title, we are humbled by the overwhelming response of both Ateneo and DLSU in the way we accepted defeat in the spirit of sportsmanship with heads unbowed. We stand united as a team to regroup and regain the crown next season. We will reassemble to begin practice on Jan. 16, after the holidays, and prepare for the PCCL National Collegiate Championships on Feb. 2-11. Management is firmly behind coach Aldin Ayo and his staff as we start the process of rebuilding for the future. We are saddened by the loss of Abu Tratter who has completed his years of UAAP eligibility and wish to thank him for his efforts in fighting to keep our glory bright. We take this opportunity to express our wholehearted appreciation to the Lasallian community for supporting us through thick and thin, through good and bad times. Now more than ever, we are strongly committed to bounce back with a resolve that is uncompromising and unflinching. We will forever hold our banner high and bright, a shield of Green and White ?? ANIMO! ?

CLEANED POST:  Report. Lakers Angry At D? Angelo Russell Over Leaked Nick Young Video Lakers players are angry at teammate D ?? Angelo Russell, have no trust in him, and are refusing to sit with him at meals, according to a report from Baxter Holmes and Marc Stein. At a recent breakfast meeting, one source said, no Laker would sit with Russell at his table. The source added that, in another instance, Russell came into the locker room and sat next to guard Lou Williams, who got up and walked away. ?? It ?? s bad, ?? one team source told Ramon Shelburne ESPN.com. It's about as bad as it can get. There were trust issues already. Now there ?? s no trust. ?? The anger stems from a video uploaded to Twitter last week by celebrity gossip website Fameolous. The video shows Russell filming teammate Nick Young while he is watching TV in a hotel room, responding to Russell's questions about women. Young talks about having hooked up with a 19-year-old woman ?? after the club ?? during the summer, seemingly admitting to having cheated on his fiancée Iggy Azalea. - D10.

CLEANED POST:  Everyone has been saying Lebron James is the Greatest of All-Time of our era because he took a team with Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Larry Hughes, Daniel Gibson as the role players to the NBA Finals, but no one mentioned that Sixers Guard Allen Iverson took a team with him being the only player on the team that made the All-Star Team, His 2nd best player (Eric Snow), was Lebron's worst player in the 2005-2006 season. Larry Hughes, who was a teammate of Lebron James in the 2007 NBA Finals averaged 22.3 Points Per Game, The 2001 Sixers bench averaged 23.7 Points Per Game (7 of Iverson's Teammates vs 1 of Lebron's Teammates). Allen Iverson took a team that had Tyrone Hill, Matt Geiger, Todd Macollugh and an Injured Dikembe Mutombo who missed half the season. All those guys I mentioned exclude "Injured" Dikembe Mutombo have never averaged 10+ points per game ever in their careers. Allen Iverson single handily won Game 1 vs the "Showtime" Lakers in 2001 scoring 4. points, and averaging 34.7 Points Per Game in the 2001 NBA Finals. Lebron James averaged 22.0 Points Per Game and shooting a Career Low 35% from FG in the 2007 NBA Finals. With all that being said. At the end of the day, did Allen Iverson choose to join Kobe and Shaq in LA? Did he make a show on t.v of him betraying his hometown to make a big 3 of shaq, iverson, and Kobe. Think about that Heat fans. Loyalty vs. Rings (the easy way out). Yet all you Miami fans are being brain-washed and mind controlled by ESPN and the media into thinking that Lebron is the greatest of all-time while they try to make everyone forget what loyalty is. This is our NBA today. Where you can literally BUY a ring, stack a team, no loyalty, no trust, nothing. Built Vs. Bought. Nasser.
