# Tagalog/Filipino Dictionary
A dictionary for the Tagalog/Filipino languages (fil/tl). Compatible with Pale Moon, Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey. Wordlist and affixes file were made by Ramil Sagum, Kevin P. Scannell, and Jan Michael Alonzo. Further additions to the wordlist & affixes files plus changes to follow the orthography (in spelling) were made by FranklinDM.

This add-on is **meant to check spelling** (it is **NOT an academic dictionary** and it does **NOT include definitions/meanings for Filipino/Tagalog words**).

To enable, right-click in a multi-line text box, select "Languages", then "Tagalog".

## Building
